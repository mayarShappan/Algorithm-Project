🌐 Graph Algorithms Visualization Website

An advanced and interactive web application designed to help users visualize, understand, and compare graph algorithms through modern animations and a fully dynamic graph builder.
This project brings complex algorithms like Dijkstra and Warshall to life using clean UI, smooth animations, and real-time step-by-step visualization.

🚀 Features
🔹 Dynamic Graph Builder

Add, edit, and delete nodes.

Add weighted or unweighted edges.

Fully interactive canvas for graph creation.

🔹 Algorithms Included

Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Single-source shortest path)

Warshall’s Algorithm (Transitive closure)

(Expandable — structure allows adding more algorithms later)

🔹 Step-by-Step Visualization

Every algorithm is animated.

Each step is highlighted on the graph.

Timeline / step navigator.

Color-coded states (visited, current, shortest path…).

🔹 Algorithm Comparison Mode

Compare Dijkstra vs Warshall side-by-side.

Automatically visualize both on the same input graph.

Detailed explanation for each step.

🔹 Educational UI

Shows pseudocode matching each step.

Real-time table updates (distance matrix, adjacency matrix…).

Tooltips, explanations, and notes for beginners.
